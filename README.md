# Belly-Button-Biodiversity
Build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

## Getting Started
1. Create a new repository and title it as you please. I have given mine the title, Belly-Button-Biodiversity.

1. Clone the new repository to your computer.

1. Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the Belly-Button-Biodiversity.

1. Create an Index.Html file, a data folder which contains the samples.json dataset and then a static\js folder which will hold the app.js file.

1. Push the above changes to GitHub.

## Summary
1. Using the D3 library, create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
